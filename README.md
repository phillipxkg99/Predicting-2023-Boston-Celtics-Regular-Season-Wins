# Predicting-2023-Boston-Celtics-Regular-Season-Wins
This is my team's final machine learning project; our team was comprised of myself, Edwin Suh, Mary Ann Nguyen, and Tessa Wu.

Our final dataset was a combination of data scapred from FiveThirtyEight and BasketballReference. 

You will find folders with the Jupyter notebooks used to clean the data, create visualizations, and create machine learning models along with our CSV file and the script used to turn the dataset into the one we used for the project.

If you want to check out our presentation that highlights the challenges that came with the project, performance, and other insights, check out the attached .pdf.
